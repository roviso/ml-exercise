# Classification Task Repository

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks and documentation related to a supervised learning classification task involving both image data and OCR-generated text data. Each notebook corresponds to a different approach to the classification task, leveraging different data sources.

## Contents

- `csv-combine.ipynb`: A programming exercise that demonstrates how to combine CSV files into a single dataset. This notebook may include data preprocessing or exploratory data analysis.

- `Programming_exercise.txt`: This text file includes the documentation for the programming exercises, providing insights into the methods used and the rationale behind them.

- `Supervised Learning Classification Task.md`: The Markdown file contains the documentation for the supervised learning classification task. It explains the problem statement, the approaches taken, and the findings from each method.

- `txt-ocr-classi.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that performs classification using OCR text data. It includes the necessary steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of results based on text data.

- `resnet-image-classi.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on classification using only image data. It utilizes a ResNet model to understand and classify images without any OCR text involvement.

- `combined-classi.ipynb`: A more comprehensive notebook that attempts classification by combining both images and OCR text data. It showcases the process of creating a model that can interpret and make predictions using both types of data.

## Instructions

To use these notebooks effectively, you will need to provide the correct file paths to your datasets:

1. Ensure you have a folder containing your image dataset and another folder for your OCR text data.
2. Update the file paths in the notebooks to point to your image and text data folders.
3. Follow the instructions within each notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

Remember to install all the necessary libraries and dependencies as mentioned in each notebook before running the cells.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repo_url>`.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, VSCode, or classic Jupyter Notebook).
4. Update the dataset file paths as necessary in each notebook.
